# sphericalgeometry
A Python module of various spherical computational geometry related functions.

This module is a work-in-progress including various spherical geometry functions that I needed and could not find in the well-known libraries.
The functions work on sets of points on the unit sphere.

The list of existing functions (to be updated):

-`sphere_convhull` - Computes the spherical convex hull of a set of points on the unit sphere (unfinished)
-`pspolydist` - Computes the minimum distance from a point to a polyline on a sphere (unfinished). This is an adaptation to Python of the original MATLAB function [`p_spoly_dist`](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52734-p_spoly_dist) by Michael Yoshpe.
